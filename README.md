# ProjectEuler

A repo where I create small mathematical programs in Haskell and Python - namely solutions to Project Euler problems (but not exclusively). 


Firstly, I hope to learn more about Haskell by solving these mathematical problems. Secondly, I decided to implement the solutions in Python as well along the way because why not - it's my default go-to programming language and the contrast of the subsequent implmentations is interesting. And lastly, I really enjoy number theory and the related fields these puzzles explore.

### Note(s) 
While I try and solve all these problems without any help/hints or guides and my 'basic' solutions are my own (think, generally, the sub-optimal solutions presented), I nonetheless, in an effort to optimise my solutions, might end up searching for those hints/help after solving the problem. I will include those optimised solutions as well with a clear separation and indication of having received help. All else that is lacking that notice is my own work.


While Project Euler generally discourages the distriubtion of solutions in public fora, they offer a certain leeway for the publishing of the first 100 problems. Read more : https://projecteuler.net/about (addressed in question containing the phrase "...publish my solution.." )
